1. Workloads (.swf files) are in standard workload format.
Please refer to http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/parallel/workload/swf.html

2. I manually parsed them into .csv files

3. `cht.yml' is a tmuxinator configuration file. It let's you easily launch the environments.
	`mux cht` to launch enviornment and `./run_SDSC.sh` or `./run_hetero_SDSC.sh` to conduct workload

4. For priority violation rate, `./normalized_violation_calculator.rb $DECISION_MAKER_LOG_FILE` will do.

5. For deadline miss penalty, `./penalty_calculators.rb [.out files...]`

6. wagap series is not working now.
